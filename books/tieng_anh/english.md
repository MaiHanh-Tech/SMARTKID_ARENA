HOW NAM HAS IMPROVED HIS ENGLISH
In the first year of lower secondary school, I had some difficulties in learning English. My 
English pronunciation was really bad and my English grammar was worse. I did not know how to 
improve them. I didn’t want my parents to know about this. 
One afternoon after the lesson, my teacher of English told me to wait for her outside the 
classroom. She took me to the school library and showed me cassettes of pronunciation drills kept 
in a glass bookcase. She also told me how to use an English – English dictionary to improve my 
English grammar. 
 “Now I think you know what you should do”, said he. I made much progress and only one year

 Graham Bell was born in Scotland in 1847, but when he was a young man of twenty-three he 
moved with his parents to Canada. Before the year was over, young Graham had left his family and 
gone to Boston. Though Bell was a dreamer , he was also a practical thinker and a man of action. In 
Boston, where he worked by day as a teacher of the deaf, he worked far into the night 
experimenting with the electrical transmission of the sound. This led to the invention of the 
telephone.

doesn’t like them, either. Although they’re twins, they’re not exactly the same at everything. Tim 
works hard at school because he wants to go to university, but Tom is a bit lazy. Our mother is often 
away from home because of her job, so we all work together in the house. Most of the time it’s fine, 
but sometimes we fight a bit!

Some have a cottage built in a village so that they can go there whenever they can find the time.
 The village green is a wide stretch of grass, and houses or cottages are built round it. Country

Dear Nga,
At last! Hooray! We finished all our exams last week. The last one was History. It was horrible. 
I think History is really difficult because I can’t remember all the facts and the dates.
I did seven subjects. The worst was Science and History. I found them very difficult. I always 
forget most of the things we’ve learned. 
The best subject this year was Geography, but we only had it twice a week. We’re going to 
Wales in the middle of August, to see my grandparents. Would you like to come with us? Mum says 
it’s ok. Please write and tell me about your year at school. What was it like? Were your exams

 HOW NAM HAS IMPROVED HIS ENGLISH
In the first year of lower secondary school, I had some difficulties in learning English. My 
pronunciation of English words really bad and my English grammar was worse. I did not know 
how to improve them. One afternoon after the lesson, my teacher of English told me to wait for 
her outside the classroom. She took me to the school library and showed me cassettes of 
pronunciation drills kept in a glass bookcase. She also told me how to use English and do some 
exercises to improve my English grammar. “ Now, I think you know what you should do”, said 
she. I tried my best and only one year later, I won the first prize in the English Speaking Contest 
held for secondary school students in my hometown.”

Many nights we pray With no proof anyone could hear And our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood Now we are not afraid Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long Before we know we could There can be miracles
When you believe Though hope is frail It's hard to kill Who know what miracle
You can achieve When you believe Somehow you will You will when you believe
In this time of fear When prayer so often proves in vain Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away And now I am standing here My heart's so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say There can be miracles
When you believe Though hope is frail It's hard to kill Who know what miracle
You can achieve When you believe Somehow you will They don't always happen when you 
ask And it's easy to give in to your fear But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see you way safe through the rain Small but still resilient voice
Says love is very near There can be miracles (miracles) When you believe (When you 
believe) Though hope is frail It's hard to kill Who know what miracles You can achieve (You 
can achieve) When you believe Somehow you will (Some how, some how, some how)
(Some how you will) No, no, no, no You will when you believe You will when you believe
You will when you believe Just believe You will when you believe You will when you believe
LỜI DỊCH: Khi bạn tin tưởng Nhiều đêm chúng ta nguyện cầu Mà không chắc một ai có thể nghe 
thấu Và trái tim ta một bài ca hi vọng Chúng ta rất hiểu Giờ đây ta không sợ hãi
Mặc dù ta biết có rất nhiều nỗi lo Ta đang vượt qua những dãy núi dàiTrước khi ta biết ta có thể
Có thể là điều kì diệu Khi bạn tin tưởng Dù cho hi vọng mỏng mảnh Nó khó có thể bị giết chết
Ai biết những điều kì diệu Bạn có thể đạt được Khi bạn tin tưởng Bằng cách nào đó bạn sẽ Bạn sẽ 
làm được khi bạn tin tưởng Trong khoảng khắc của sự sợ hãi Khi những lời cầu nguyện chỉ là vô 
hiệu Hi vọng giống như cánh chim mùa hè Bay đi quá nhanh Và giờ tôi đứng ở đây
Trái tim tôi hết sức ngập tràn tôi không thể giải thích Cố gắng kiếm tìm niềm tin và nói thành lời
Tôi chưa bao giờ nghĩ rằng tôi đã nói Có thể là điều kì diệu Khi bạn tin tưởng (Khi bạn tin tưởng) 
ĐỖ DIỆU HUYỀN E8 Page 41
Dù cho hi vọng là mong manh Nó khó có thể tiêu tan Ai biết những điều kì diệu
Bạn có thể vươn tới (Bạn có thể đạt được) Khi bạn tin tưởng Bằng cách nào đó bạn sẽ
Bạn sẽ làm được khi bạn tin tưởng Phép nhiệm màu không đến chỉ vì bạn mong muốn
Và thật quá dễ dàng để đầu hàng sợ hãi Nhưng khi bạn mù quáng đi vì nỗi đau
Không thể nhìn thấy cách bạn an toàn xuyên cơn mưa Nhỏ thôi nhưng là tiếng nói vẫn có thể phục 
hồi Nói lên rằng tình yêu ở rất gần rồi đấy Có thể là phép màu nhiệm (diệu kì)
Khi bạn tin tưởng (Khi bạn tin tưởng)Dù cho hi vọng là mong manh Nó khó có thể tiêu tan
Ai biết những điều kì diệu Bạn có thể vươn tới (Bạn có thể chạm tới)Khi bạn tin tưởng
Bằng cách nào đó bạn sẽ(Bằng cách nào đó, bằng cách nào đó, bằng cách nào đó)
Bằng cách nào đó bạn sẽ (Không, không, không, không) Bạn sẽ đạt được khi bạn tin tưởng

Once upon a time there was a girl called Cindy. She had to work very hard all day while her lazy sister did nothing. 
One night her sister went to a party at the palace. Cindy was very sad because she had to be at home. Suddenly, a 
fairy appeared and told her that she could go to the party.She also changed Cindy’s rags into beautiful clothes. 
Then she went to the party and danced with the Prince. At midnight she ran back home, leaving one of her shoes on 
the dance floor. The prince wanted to see her again and went to every house in the capital until he found that the 
shoe was the right size for Cindy. She and the Prince were married and lived happily ever after.

Just a few years ago, this place was called Dumptown. The people living here didn’t think much about where waste 
went when they threw it out. Things that could be reused or recycled were thrown in the trash, because nobody 
believed recycling made a difference. And, eventually, that became a very big problem.
The garbage heap grew and began to smell. Sometimes it caught fire, and making it hard for everyone to breathe. 
Dumptowners knew they had to fix it.
They learned to reduce the amount of waste they threw away. For example, they learned to reuse things—like 
washing out empty jars in - stead of throwing them away. And, they learned to recycle. They set up bins around 
town to collect glass, paper, and other things, then made into new products.

Thanksgiving Day is a holiday that Americans celebrate the honor of everything the country offered to their 
ancestors, who were among the first immigrants to the U.S. when they first came to America, they saw that there 
were enough food and opportunity for everyone. They were even helped by the Indians who taught them how to 
grow all kinds of new vegetables, such as corn and yams, or sweet potatoes.
On Thanksgiving Day, it’s traditional to eat a big meal together. The Americans eat food that was found 
here by their ancestors. They usually eat turkey with sweet potatoes, Indian corn bread, and have pumpkin pie for 
dessert. Every Thanksgiving Day, a giant parade is held by one of the most famous department stores in New York. 
It’s an yearly event. And at the end of the parade, children can even see Santa Claus, who is visiting from the North 
Pole. Santa Claus is invited to remind children and parents that Christmas is not far away.

This report shows how the Mid-Autumn festival was held in the Cultural House in my village. The Mid-Autumn 
festival was held on the 15th of August (According to Lunar Calendar). This festival was specially organized for 
children. The main festival lasted for about three hours when the Moon is at its fullest. During the festival, children 
took part in various activities like singing and shouting, wearing masks, parading on the roads and banging the 
drums. Besides, children ate a very special cake called Moon Cakes. I think this festival is a very special occasion 
for Vietnamese people and for children to play and enjoy on variety of activities. Moreover, children would

Have you ever wondered what the weather is like in other places around the world? Today, I’d like to talk about 
the changing seasons in my city. The winter season usually begins in December and ends in early March. The 
coldest month is January, and temperatures can drop below freezing for most of this month. The city usually 
averages about 30 inches of snow during this 3-month period. Occasionally, we have snow storms that can drop a 
foot of snow in a very short period of time. Spring usually arrives in late March, it’s a beautiful season because the 
flowers start to bloom. It is sometimes windy, and this is great for flying kites. People in my city often like to go on 
picnics, stroll though parks, and play outdoor games. Summer starts in June and it’s very dry with little rain 
throughout the season. Fortunately, the weather is very dry with low humidity, so it is real pleasant even on hot 
days. And finally, summer changes to fall in late September when the weather cools off, and the trees begin to 
change colors. A lot of people enjoy driving into the mountains and viewing the fall colors.

được thoả mãn. Nếu nói về tương lai, dạng câu này được sử dụng khi nói đến một điều kiện có thể
thực hiện được hoặc có thể xảy ra. Mệnh đề If Mệnh đề chính
1. S + V[-e/es]
2. S + don’t / doesn’t + V(inf)
1. S + will + V(inf)
2. S + will not + V(inf)
Note: V+……. +or+S+will/won’t+V+……. . = Unless S +V+…. , S+will/won’t+V+……
10
= If S don’t/doesn’t + V, S+will/won’t+V+……
Eg: -Study hard or you will fail the exam. = Unless you study hard , you will fail the exam. = If you don’t study hard , you will fail the exam. -Cut your hair or they won’t let you in. = Unless you cut your hair , they won’t let you in. = If you don’t cut your hair , they won’t let you in. *, Diễn tả 1 sự thật luôn luôn đúng ở quá khứ. Ta có cấu trúc:
If + S + Simple Past, S+ Simple Past. Eg: We went home early if it was foggy. Ghi chú :- Sau mệnh đề If hoặc mệnh đề Unless phải có dấu phẩy (, )
- Sau Unless không được dùng dạng phủ định (Ví dụ : không được viết Unless you don’t
write)
*, Command (Thức mệnh lệnh)
Form: If + S + V(s-es), V(mệnh lệnh)+ . . . . . . Eg: - If you go to the Post Office, mail this letter for me. - Please call me if you hear anything from Jane. b, Loại 2:Điều kiện ko có thật ở hiện tại: -Câu điều kiện ko có thực ở hiện tại dùng để đề cập đến những tình huống tưởng tượng hoặc
ko thể xảy
ra ở hiện tại. Form:
If S+were/V-ed +sb/Noun/adj , S+would/wouldn’t/could/couldn’t+V+…. . *Note: *Động từ to be phải chia là were ở tất cả các ngôi. Eg:-If I were rich, I would travel around the world. - If I had money, I would buy the car. - If I were you, I wouldn't see that movie. c, Loại 3:Điều kiện không thể xảy ra trong quá khứ: - Câu điều kiện không thể xảy ra trong quá khứ dùng để đề cập những tình huống không có
thật trong QK. Form: If+had/hadn’t+V-ed/pII, S+would/wouldn’t/could/couldn’t+have+V-ed/pII……
Eg:-If I hadn’t been in a hurry, I wouldn’t have had an accident. - If I had had money, I would have bought the car. * Chú ý rằng cũng có thể thể hiện một điều kiện không có thực mà không dùng if. Trong
11
trườnghợp đó, trợ động từ had được đưa lên đầu câu, đứng trước chủ ngữ. Mệnh đềđiều
kiện sẽ đứng trước mệnh đề chính. Eg: - Had we known that you were there, we would have written you a letter. - Had he studied harder for the test, he would have passed it. Lưu ý: Câu điều kiện không phải lúc nào cũng tuân theo qui luật trên. Trong một số
trường hợp đặc biệt, một vế của điều kiện là quá khứ nhưng vế còn lại có thểở hiện tại (do thời gian
qui định). Eg: - If she had caught the train, she would be here by now. 2. Một số cấu trúc đặc biệt:
a, Cấu trúc BUT FOR. Nó thay thế cho cấu trúc " IF . . . . . . . NOT". Dạng này thường sử dụng trong văn phong lịch
sự. Form:But for+Noun, S+………. Eg:If you hadn't helped us, we would have been in trouble. => But for your help, we would have been in trouble. 4. Câu điều ước:
I. Các dạng câu điều ước :
1. Điều ước ở hiện tại : - Dùng để diễn đạt mong ước của ai đó về một điều gì đó không có thật hoặc không thể xảy ra
hay không thể thực hiện được ở hiện tại. - Form :
* Với động từ “tobe:S1+wish(es)+S2+were(not)+…. . * Với động từ thường:S1+wish(es)+S2+V(qk)/didn’t V +……
+ Chú ý : Động từ “tobe” were được dùng với tất cả các ngôi. Eg:-Kris wishes he were a famous person. -Trung wishes he had a car. 2. Điều ước trong tương lai : - Diễn tả mong muốn điều gì sẽ sảy ra hoặc muốn ai đó làm điều gì đó. - Form :
* Với động từ “tobe”:S1+wish(es)+S2+ would /could /should (+not)+be +………
* Với động từ thường:S1+ wish(es) + S2+ would /could/should (+not) + V+……. . Eg:I wish you could come here again. 3. Điều ước ở quá khứ :
12
- Diễn tả mong ước một điều gì đó đã xảy ra trong quá khứ, sự hối tiếc về một điều gì đó đã
không xảy ra. - Form:
* Với động từ “tobe”: S + wish(es) + S + had (+not)+been +………
* Với động từ thường: S + wish(es) + S + had (+not)+V-ed/pII+……

wish(es)

ngữ số nhiều)
Eg:Jim, along with his parents, is going to the movie tonight. Jim and his parents are going to the movie tonight. -Nếu 2 đồng chủ ngữ nối với nhau bởi “or” thì động từ phải chia theo danh từ đứng sau “or” Eg: John or his wife will come to Rin’s wedding. -Either, neither(nếu không đi cùng với or và nor)+Danh từ, ta luôn chia ở số ít.

Eg:Neither John nor his friends are going to the beach today. -Danh từ “None”có thể sử dụng với cả danh từ số ít và danh từ số nhiều. Khi đó động từ được
chia theo danh từ đi sau “None of the”. Eg:+None of the counterfeit money(tiền giả) has been found. +None of the students have finished the exam. -“No” và “Some of the” tương tự như “None of the”. -V-ing được coi là chủ ngữ số ít. Eg:Fishing is one of my favorite pastime. -Các danh từ chỉ tập thể(Congress, Organization, Class, Staff, Committee:ủyban;Family;Group;Team;Army:quân đội;Crowd;Minority:thiểu số;Public) thường
được coi là số ít. Nhưng khi các thành viên hoạt động riêng lẻ(in disagreement about st:bất đồng ý
kiến về…/ discuss:bàn luận)
thì lại là danh từ số nhiều. Eg:+Congress has initiated(đề xướng) a new plan to combat(chống lại) inflation(sự lạm phát). +The committee has met and it has rejected the proposal. +Congress are discussing about the bill. -The majority(đa số)+V(số ít) / The majority of N(số nhiều) +V(số nhiều)…
Eg:-The majority believes that we are in no danger.
17
-The majority of the students believe him to be innocent(vô tội). -Một số danh từ đặc biệt luôn được coi là số nhiều:police;fish;sheep;scissors;…)/assets(tài
sản)luôn là số nhiều/measles(bệnh sởi) số ít. -A couple+V(số ít)+…. The couple+V(số nhiều)+…. . Eg:A couple is walking on the path(đường mòn). The couple are racing their horse. -Các cụm từ cùng phối hợp chỉ một nhóm ĐV:flock of birds/sheep;school of fish/herd of
cattle/pride of lion/pack of dog. Luôn được coi là danh từ số ít. -Tất cả những danh từ chỉ thời gian, số đo, tiền tệ, phép tính được đề cập đến như 1 thể thống nhất
được coi là danh từ số ít. Eg:Ten dollars is a high price to pay. Two miles is too much to run in one day. -A number of+N(số nhiều)+V(số nhiều). . -The number of +N(số nhiều)+ V(số ít)…
Eg:- A number of hours have passed. (Một vài giờ đồng hồ đã trôi qua. )
